# Lid-Driven Cavity: Incompressible Navier–Stokes

* Developed a 2D incompressible Navier–Stokes solver for the lid-driven cavity using the vorticity–streamfunction.
* Validated results against benchmark Ghia et al. data and analysed Reynolds-number-dependent flow structures, including vortex formation and secondary eddies, using velocity profiles and streamline contours.
* Unsteady, CFL, Adaptive time-stepping, 
* The vorticity-stream function formulation implifies 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations by eliminating pressure, replacing them with a scalar vorticity transport equation and a Poisson equation for the stream function
