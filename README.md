# Lid-Driven Cavity: Incompressible Navier–Stokes

* Developed a 2D incompressible Navier–Stokes solver for the lid-driven cavity using the vorticity–streamfunction.
* Validated results against benchmark Ghia et al. data and analysed Reynolds-number-dependent flow structures, including vortex formation and secondary eddies, using velocity profiles and streamline contours.
